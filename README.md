# R Cafe

The R Cafe is a community event for R users of Utrecht University and UMCU. The goal 
of the event is to share knowledge about R and help researchers with programming
problems. The meeting lasts 2 hours, is held every month, and is open without 
registration.

This repository contains additional material for the R Cafe. There are several 
exercises and tips in the [exercises folder](/exercises/). 

During each event, an R user demonstrates an interesting package or application of R. 
The additional material for the demonstrations can be found in the [themes folder](/themes/).


## Themes

Each R Cafe has a special theme. The theme is a short presentation or
demonstration of (maximum) half an hour. The presentations are given by attendees of the
Cafe. We are always looking for people who want to present something. Please
send an email to Jonathan de Bruin ([j.debruin1@uu.nl](mailto:j.debruin1@uu.nl)) to request to give a
presentation.
