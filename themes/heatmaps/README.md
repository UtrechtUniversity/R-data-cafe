# Heatmaps
Large datasets can be challenging to comprehend, but visualizations can help to summarize and clarify. Yet even visualizations can be overly complex, defeating their purpose. During this showcase, we will focus on one particularly powerful yet self-explanatory type of visualization: heatmaps. Heatmaps can be applied to all kinds of data — from raw data to the results of statistical analyses — and use colors the way other visualizations use e.g. heights, to easily and attractively map out data in 3D. During this showcase we will demonstrate how to use and customize heatmaps in R, and how to tweak your data to make the most of a heatmap visualization.
