# Code Snippets in RStudio

RStudio is a powerful interface for R. RStudio contains many useful features to
simplify and speed up coding. Examples of these features are code snippets and
keyboard shortcuts. Code snippets are text macros that are used for quickly
inserting common snippets of code. In this showcase, we explain how to use and
create code snippets and keyboard shortcuts. By defining your own code snippets
and keyboard shortcuts, you can write R code lighting fast! After the
demonstration, we share our code snippets.

Example snippets can be found in `r.snippets`
