# Long and wide data

`reshape`, `melt`, `cast`, `recast`, `gather`, `spread`, `stack`, `unstack`... 
You might have some experience with these functions: they can be used to transform data from a wide format 
into a long format and vice versa, and are therefore essential for statistics and visualisation in R. 
But these transformations are not always intuitive, and it can be tricky to wrap your head around what happens 
to your data when you change the shape of your data frame. 

During this showcase, we will explain the ins and outs of long and wide in R!
